# Data Science Portfolio
A collection of the data science projects that I completed for academic, self learning and out-of-curiosity purposes.

## Contents
### Course-Projects
- [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/Sturmpuls/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/charityml/finding_donors.ipynb): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.

- [Supervised Learning: Classifying Flower Images with Neural Networks](https://github.com/ffrosch/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/flower-classifier/Image%20Classifier%20Project.ipynb): Using a pre-trained classifier to build a new classifier that can identify 102 flower images. Additionally wrapping it all in a [commandline application](https://github.com/ffrosch/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/flower-classifier) that let's users choose an algorithm, retrain it on a new image set and predict a class for a new image.

- [Unsupervised Learning: Identify Customer Segments](https://github.com/ffrosch/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/identify-customer-segments/Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb): Using unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.
